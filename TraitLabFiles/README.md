# Files accompanying the TraitLab analyses

We analysed the complete data set using the Stochastic Dollo model of TraitLab 2014, which can be downloaded from https://sites.google.com/site/traitlab/downloads.

First copy the contents of the clades.txt file at the end of the relevant .nex file (the file `LexicalData/data/sino-tibetan-traitlab.nex`).

The .par file then lists all the parameters necessary to reproduce our results.
