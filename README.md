# Data and source code accompanying the paper "Dated language phylogenies shed light on the ancestry of Sino-Tibetan"

## Overview

this is something like our table of content, we can convert this document later on via pandoc, so we can list references as @AuthorYear inline and convert to DOC and PDF and latex with a bibtex file.

## Linguistic Data and Code for Data-Curation and Conversion

* Mattis will describe the linguistic data here, and in which format it appears
* this will include a table of the languages and a table of the concepts and a link to a fresh EDICOTR setup (file-based)

## Data and Code for Phylogenetic Experiments

* here, Valentin and Robin are free to add their description and additional experiments
